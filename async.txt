 ****************************** Async *****************
         we use Async in Javascript because Javascript have single thread(we cannot execute multible things) for this problem we use Async.
         
         setTimeout() --> this method have two arguments one for callback method and second one for seting the time.
         program --> from 1 to 15 

          - creating problem
          for example :
            when we have 3 functions 
               1.for bring the data 
               2.calculate the data 
               3.display the data.
            At this time do not display the data because data are not present then how to display it.
            we can stop by three ways first one has over which is callback Hell.
            2nd one promises and 3rd one is Async-await.


**************** promises ***************

It is most usible then async. It is a class. which has two arguments. resolve & reject. 
resolve : 
  resolve is function which is use for completly execute. Means when the function is full execute
reject : 
 reject is also a function which is use for incompletly execute. when reject is return from the promise then it will break. 
The names of resolve and reject can be anything.

  syntax :
    new promise((resolve, reject) => {}) 

program --> from 72 to 105

promises are implimented in liberary already. we don't have to implimente like manually.


************** async-await ***************

It is most usible then promise. It actually promise but it has little changes in written form.
when we use async-await we should make async function. inside this function we can call await function. for example.

async function run() {
   await one();
   await two();
   await three();
}

run();
